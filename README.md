# Education4You
The Education4You is the faculty recommendation for students based on their choices where I suggest the top-n recommendation to students by arranging the recommendations in descending order of recommended score.

This project is a prototype for the “Education4You – The Deep Learning Based Faculty Recommender System”. This has been implemented under the guidance of college professors. This project is useful for students where students can resolve their query by contacting the teachers recommended by us.

With the increase in number of technologies we are getting more advanced day by day. But we are also lacking somewhere like in the education field. The students are not be able to get the solution of their problem in mean time when they caught any problem whose solution they need immediately. 

The online query portal like “Quora”, “StackOverflow”, etc. gives efficient solution without any doubt but to get solution from this we need to post the problem and we get the solution after 24hours. And again if we not able to understand the problem then the query resolution process takes a several recursive process which causes many difficulties to students.

In this particular project I aim for designing the recommendation system which suggest the teacher to students based on the technology behind particular query searched by the students and the teachers will be recommended based on the ratings given to them by other students and the problem solved by them.

In the current growing technical world, we as a students need a platform which connect us to the world’s best teachers with whom we can resolve our doubts in mean time when the doubts arises by communicating them directly so that we preserve our time and our work will not get halted in between.
